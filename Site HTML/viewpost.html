                        Considering Foster played exactly 800 games in a 21-year career, that is a lot of care and devotion on the part of the kit man’s wife. She might want to look away now.
                        ‘I just used to throw them on the dressing-room floor afterwards - they were a necessity, not a fashion statement,’ he says.
                        It is a shame, he agrees that a Steve Foster headband would fetch a few quid on eBay. He adds: ’People say to me now, “Where’s the headband?”. I say, “Oh s***, is it not on? It must have fallen off”.’
                        Foster did not always wear one. Not when he was coming through at hometown club Portsmouth, and not even in his first season at Brighton after a £150,000 move in 1979.
                        The story of how it came about involves two players who went on to become household names on television, which is ironic given that Foster’s brow was left disfigured. Old Brighton team-mate, Michael Robinson, is one of Spain’s most famous football presenters, the other player was former Sky pundit Andy Gray.
                        Foster takes up the tale. ‘We had a tactic where one player would run to the near post as a corner was about to be taken before turning and acting as a blocker - and I would run in for a free header,’ says the man who scored 52 career goals from such ploys.
                        ‘One game, Michael made the run. I came steaming in and suddenly thought, “Where’s the blocker?”. It was too late. Andy Gray smashed me straight in the middle of my head. It split right open. Michael had forgotten his part of the routine and was leaning over me, “Oh, shit. Sorry”.’
